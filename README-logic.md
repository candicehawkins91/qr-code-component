First commit was downloading the project and its files.

2. I found the image for the qr code.
I also found what I wanted my end product to look like.

3. I wrapped my img around divs just in case I need to edit both. Although I know I am doing some things right I also know I am doing somethings wrong as well. Just wanted to let you in my mind this time.

4. Another commit just for this README.md
